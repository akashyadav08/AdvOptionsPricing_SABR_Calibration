# AdvOptionsPricing_SABR

This project aims to use real market data to calibrate SABR model and use two variance reduction techniques while computing option prices using Monte-Carlo.

Other than standard libraries NumPy and Pandas, matplotlib is used for plotting, SciPy optimize for comparison with hard coded Gradient Descent and Pickle to store data from long run MC simulations. The data saved is presented in Data folder as well. 

Plots for both .ipynb files are also presented.
